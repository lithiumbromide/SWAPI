# ModelDoc2::FeatureCut2

This method is obsolete and has been superseded by [ModelDoc2::FeatureCut3](ModelDoc2__FeatureCut3.htm).

Description

This method create a cut feature.

Syntax (OLE Automation)

void ModelDoc2.FeatureCut2 ( sd, flip, dir, t1, t2, d1, d2, dchk1, dchk2, ddir1, ddir2, dang1, dang2, offsetReverse1, offsetReverse2, keepPieceIndex )

| Input: | (BOOL) sd | TRUE for single-ended, FALSE for double-ended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input: | (BOOL) flip | Flip side to cut; TRUE if you want to remove the material outside of the profile |
| Input: | (BOOL) dir | Reverse direction; TRUE if you want Direction1 to be opposite the default direction |
| Input: | (long) t1 | Termination type for first end as defined in swEndConditions_e |
| Input: | (long) t2 | Termination type for second end as defined in swEndConditions_e |
| Input: | (double) d1 | Depth of extrusion for first end in meters |
| Input: | (double) d2 | Depth of extrusion for second end in meters |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk1 | TRUE allows draft angle in first direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) dchk2 | TRUE allows draft angle in second direction, FALSE does not allow drafting |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir1 | TRUE for first draft angle to be inward, FALSE for draft angle outward |
| Input: | (BOOL) ddir2 | TRUE for second draft angle to be inward, FALSE for draft angle outward |
| Input: | (double) dang1 | Draft angle for first end |
| Input: | (double) dang2 | Draft angle for second end |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse1 | TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch if you chose to offset the first end condition from another face or plane, FALSE specifies offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch |
| Input: | (BOOL) offsetReverse2 | TRUE specifies offset in direction away from the sketch if you chose to offset the second end condition from another face or plane, FALSE specifies offset from the face or plane in a direction toward the sketch |
| Input: | (long) keepPieceIndex | Piece to keep if ambiguity exists |

Remarks

The default direction for cut operations is opposite the sketch normal. The default direction for boss operations is along the sketch normal. Setting the dir argument to TRUE reverses the default direction. For double-ended extrusions, Direction2 is always opposite to Direction1.

The default sketch normal is the same as the face or plane normal where the sketch was placed. To determine this normal vector, see Face::Normal and RefPlane::GetRefPlaneParams, respectively.

When there is ambiguity as the result of a cut, the keepPieceIndex is used to resolve which of the possible results is used. This can be set to -1 if there is no ambiguity; otherwise, it should be the index of the result, starting from 0 (up to 1 less than the possible number of outcomes.)
